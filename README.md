# Project Description
  * This game would be a countdown game (think bomb defusing) with multiple mini-games/puzzles that one has to beat in order to stop the timer.  

# Greater Detailed Project
  * This countdown game would require a user to beat a set of tasks within a set time requirement in order to win. If the duration of gameplay at any point goes over the allotted time, then the session will be over and the user will have lost. The mini-games and puzzles we have in mind involve a combination of games and more technical challenges. For example, a user may be prompted to complete a game of "Lights Out", then answer a logic puzzle, before being asked to write some code. Upon completion of all of the mini-games in a round in under the allotted time, the user will be victorious.
  
# User Stories
  * As a programmer, I can design riddles so that the user can have a riddle as a mini-game.
  * As a programmer, I can create programming challenges so the user can test their programming skills in a mini-game.
  * As a programmer, I can make a mini-game like "Lights Out" so the user can also play les technical games.
  * As a user, I would like to have a timer so that I can be pushed to work hard in order to defuse the bomb
  * As a user, I would like to have a diverse set of games to play so that I don't get bored.
  
# Notes
  * We think this app will be pretty fun!

# Issues
  * Create a GUI for the project
  * Design the "Lights Out" mini-game
  * Determine a way to assign mini-games to play
  * Determine appropriate length of time for main countdown
  * Create programming challenges (preferrably in java or theoretical)
  * Pull specific mini-games from pool of mini-games created for main countdown game
