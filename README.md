# Project Description
  * This game would be a countdown game (think bomb defusing) with multiple mini-games/puzzles that one has to beat in order to stop the timer.  

# Greater Detailed Project
  * This countdown game would require a user to beat a set of tasks within a set time requirement in order to win. If the duration of gameplay at any point goes over the allotted time, then the session will be over and the user will have lost. The mini-games and puzzles we have in mind involve a combination of games and more technical challenges. For example, a user may be prompted to complete a game of "Lights Out", then answer a logic puzzle, before being asked to write some code. Upon completion of all of the mini-games in a round in under the allotted time, the user will be victorious.
